# Prompt

I want to discuss an idea. I want a front end app that focus on a single view. the view should have one input at the top of the view for time HH:MM. Then there should be a grid of 4 boxes. each box will have a small rendering of the time. the top left will be simple text rendering of time like a digital clock, the top right shows an analog clock. the bottom two should have a linear axis and pointer for the hour and minute. What js and css libs would be simplest and fastest to do this?
